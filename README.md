## CourseDapp - A Course Selling App using NextJS, TailwindCSS, Shadcn, Appwrite, Typescript and Zustand.

In this website users can create their own account and then sell their courses. There are dedicated profiles for the users where they can upload their notes / course materials. After uploading, each course / material will have a specific page for them which they can share.
People can buy these courses from their website with either crypto or other payment gateways.
The platform will keep some of the commission and the rest of it will be credited directly to user's bank account or crypto wallet depending on his/her preference.
